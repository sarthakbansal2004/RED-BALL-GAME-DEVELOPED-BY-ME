# RED-BALL-GAME-DEVELOPED-BY-ME

I have developed this game by the help of Unity Engine and C#. I have also put audio in this game and this game work with the help of Keyboard.

INSTRUCTIONS: Ball Jump by using space button and ball move forwards by using 'D' button and ball move backwards by using 'A' button. This is also my first game those developed by me.

Game's file is more than 25MB, so it is unable to upload on Gibhub, so I uploaded this file to MediaFire
